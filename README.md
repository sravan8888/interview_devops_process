# interview_devops_process
Good question!  
If you have **3 years of experience in AWS DevOps**, an interviewer will expect a **mix of hands-on knowledge + clear understanding of concepts + real project examples**. Here's what they typically look for:

---

### 1. **Strong Fundamentals**
- **AWS services**: EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, CloudWatch, CloudFormation, ELB, Auto Scaling, RDS basics.
- **DevOps tools**: Git, Jenkins, Terraform/CloudFormation, Docker, Kubernetes (even basic level), Ansible.
- **CI/CD** pipelines: How to create, manage, troubleshoot.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: (Terraform mainly, or CloudFormation).
- **Monitoring & Logging**: (CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana basics).
- **Security best practices**: IAM roles, policies, key management (KMS), VPC security groups, NACLs.

---

### 2. **Practical Experience**
They will ask:
- **What kind of projects did you work on?**
- **How did you deploy applications?**
- **How do you troubleshoot when a build/deployment fails?**
- **Have you handled scaling, load balancers, disaster recovery?**

**Real-world examples** matter a lot. Even a small project experience explained clearly can impress.

---

### 3. **Problem-solving Mindset**
- How do you **debug a failing deployment**?
- How to **optimize a slow application**?
- What to do if **EC2 instance is not reachable**?
- How would you **secure a S3 bucket**?

---

### 4. **Scripting Skills**
- Basics of **Bash scripting**.
- Some knowledge of **Python** is a plus (for Lambda scripts, automation).

---

### 5. **Good Communication**
- Explaining things **clearly** without getting lost in jargon.
- If you don't know something, say "**I haven't worked deeply on this, but I can learn it quickly**" â€” interviewers respect honesty + learning attitude.

---

### Quick Example:
Suppose they ask:
> "How do you create a VPC from scratch?"

You should be able to explain:
- Create VPC âž” create subnets (public/private) âž” create route tables âž” attach internet gateway âž” security groups âž” EC2 instances inside subnets âž” NAT Gateway for private subnet âž” etc.

Even if you miss some steps, they care about your **approach**.

---

### Summary:
| Skill | Level they expect |
|:-----|:------------------|
| AWS core services | Good hands-on |
| CI/CD Pipelines | Able to design and fix |
| Infrastructure as Code | Terraform basic to intermediate |
| Scripting | Basic |
| Kubernetes | Basic understanding (optional but bonus) |
| Monitoring | Basic CloudWatch, alarms |
